# layline.io Configuration File: Prometheus Mapping

Sample file for an easy integration of Prometheus metric configurations into any layline.io project.

## Description

This sample configuration file is a quickstart for integrating Prometheus metric mappings 
when using layline.io for message processing and having configured Extension Asset *Prometheus*. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* layline.io v1.2.26 or higher. Download [here](https://layline.io/download).
* supported OS (Windows, macOS, linux)

### Usage
Having configured the Extension Asset *Prometheus*, 
you can place this file into your layline.io project structure under:
